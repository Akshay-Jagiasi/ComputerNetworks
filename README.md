### OSI Model Layers (Real-Life Scenarios)
###### Physical Layer (Layer 1):
 Scenario: Wires, cables, or Wi-Fi signals – like the roads cars drive on.
 Purpose: Deals with the actual transmission of raw data (bits) over a physical medium.

###### Data Link Layer (Layer 2):
###### Scenario: Traffic lights and street signs – regulate traffic flow to avoid collisions on the roads.
###### Purpose: Ensures reliable transmission of data across a single link, dealing with errors and data framing.

###### Network Layer (Layer 3):
###### Scenario: GPS navigation system – decides the best route to get to your destination (packets from source to destination).
###### Purpose: Handles routing and forwarding of data packets across different networks.

###### Transport Layer (Layer 4):
###### Scenario: Delivery service – makes sure your package arrives safely and in order.
###### Purpose: Ensures reliable data transfer between hosts (e.g., TCP for reliable, UDP for fast transfer).

###### Session Layer (Layer 5):
###### Scenario: Phone call – establishes, maintains, and ends the call between two people.
###### Purpose: Manages sessions between devices (start, manage, terminate communication).

###### Presentation Layer (Layer 6):
###### Scenario: Translator – ensures both parties understand the language used in communication.
###### Purpose: Translates data between different formats (encryption, compression, encoding).

###### Application Layer (Layer 7):
###### Scenario: Apps on your phone (e.g., WhatsApp, Gmail) – what you interact with directly.
###### Purpose: Provides services directly to the user, enabling communication (HTTP, FTP, etc.).
